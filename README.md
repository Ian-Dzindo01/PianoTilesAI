# PianoTilesAI
A simple AI created to achieve a very high score on the game Piano Tiles. Link to the specific game being used: https://www.yiv.com/Piano-Tiles-2-Online.
This project was inspired and aided by Code Bullet: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q.

The script has a countdown of 3 seconds before starting. The game must be started and it must be in the right position on the screen. The script clicks the start button by itself. The highest score achieved by now is 2141, but that number can be improved greatly by compensating for the mouse click delay, which was already done, up to a certain extent.
